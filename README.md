MVC-ecommerce-store
===================

This is a basic e-Commerce store in ASP.NET MVC 5

In my quest to learn ASP.NET MVC I began by reading Pro ASP.NET MVC 5 by Apress.  

This project is the sample "real world" application that the author walks you through.  It is a basic e-Commerce site and includes the following features:

	*Online Product Catalog
	*A shopping cart
	*A checkout page
	*and an administrative section to manage the catalog.

There is a lot missing from this as it's a walkthrough application.  Some of the core features it is missing are:

	*Payment processing
	*Order fulfillment
	*Analytics
	*Customer accounts (with history)
	*A Customer Service back end (for dealing with any type of problems)
	*Product promotions
	
It is my intention that these additional features will be added to future releases.
